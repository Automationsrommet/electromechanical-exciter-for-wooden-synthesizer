# electromechanical-exciter-for-wooden-synthesizer

Im thinking to go with Ralphs video code on his fridge-sound-beep with two pins, sidesetting them to four pins.

Then take the outputs from those four pins and amplify them with a push pull transistor amp.
wind a slim coil onto a bolt or the like. Perhaps something hollow like a brake pipe. wind another coil on a tubesegment that moves freely over the one coiled bolt and fits snugly in some metal lump that can be screwed onto a wooden shelf. This too might benefit from being thin, hence less permeability. Migth even allow statorwinding on the outside of the stator tube. this now being thin as a straw
Two of these wood-speakers should be integrated at either end of the pedal synthesizer having a repo elsewhere hereabouts.

openscad file will arrive here at some point.
